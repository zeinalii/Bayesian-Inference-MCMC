# Bayesian Inference with MCMC in Python

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, implemented in Python. We explore both from-scratch implementations and the use of PyMC3 for more advanced applications.

## Contents

1. [MCMC Basics](notebooks/01_mcmc_basics.ipynb)
2. [Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm](notebooks/02_metropolis_hastings.ipynb)
3. [PyMC3 Examples](notebooks/03_pymc3_examples.ipynb)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bayesian-mcmc-python.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
